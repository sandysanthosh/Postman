# Postman

To test an API in Postman, you can follow these steps:

Install the Postman app from the website (https://www.postman.com/)

Open the Postman app and click on the "New" button to create a new request.

Select the HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) that corresponds to the API endpoint you want to test.

Enter the URL of the API endpoint in the "Enter request URL" field.

If the API endpoint requires any parameters, you can add them in the "Params" tab.

If the API endpoint requires any headers, you can add them in the "Headers" tab.

If the API endpoint requires a request body, you can add it in the "Body" tab.

Click on the "Send" button to send the request to the API endpoint.

The API's response will be displayed in the "Response" tab. You can check the response status code and the response body to determine if the API is working as expected.

You can also save the requests and responses for future use by creating a collection in postman.

You can also automate the API testing by creating a postman collection and running it via command line using Newman
